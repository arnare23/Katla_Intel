                <p>We have delivered solutions across marine and fishing, finance, manufacturing, legal, and technology sectors. That said, our neural network systems are built around your data and processes, not a fixed industry template. If your business generates data and makes decisions based on it, we can likely help — whether that means forecasting demand, automating document workflows, or building computer vision systems for quality inspection. Reach out and we'll quickly assess whether there's a fit.</p>

              <span>How long does a typical project take?</span>

                <p>It depends on scope, but as a guide: a focused proof-of-concept typically takes 4–6 weeks, while a full production-ready system lands in the 3–6 month range. Every engagement follows our four-step process — Discover, Design, Develop, Deploy — so we set clear milestones from day one. During the initial discovery call we'll map out a realistic timeline based on your data readiness, integration needs, and desired outcomes.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 3 -->
          <div class="accordion__item">
            <button class="accordion__trigger" aria-expanded="false">
              <span>Do we need to have our data ready?</span>

            <div class="accordion__content">
              <div class="accordion__body">
                <p>Not at all — that's what our Discover phase is for. We start by auditing the data you already have, identifying gaps, and working with your team to clean and structure everything before any modelling begins. Many of our clients come to us knowing they're sitting on valuable data but unsure how to use it. We'll guide you through the entire process, from raw data to a trained, deployed model.</p>

            <button class="accordion__trigger" aria-expanded="false">
              <span>What's your pricing model?</span>

            <div class="accordion__content">
              <div class="accordion__body">
                <p>We keep pricing straightforward. Development projects are scoped with fixed-price milestones so you always know what you're paying for before work begins. For ongoing advisory and optimisation work we offer retainer arrangements, and standalone consulting is billed at a day rate. We'll recommend the model that makes the most sense for your situation during our first conversation — no surprises.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 5 -->
          <div class="accordion__item">
            <button class="accordion__trigger" aria-expanded="false">
              <span>Can you work with our existing tech stack?</span>

            <div class="accordion__content">
              <div class="accordion__body">
                <p>Absolutely. We design every solution to slot into your current infrastructure, not the other way around. Whether you run on AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premise servers, or a hybrid setup, we'll architect the system to integrate cleanly with your existing tools and pipelines. During the Design phase we map out exactly how the new system connects to what you already have, so deployment is smooth and your team isn't forced to learn an entirely new stack.</p>
